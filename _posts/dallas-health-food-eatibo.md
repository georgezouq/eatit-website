**Quick answer:** Dallas has a wide range of “healthy” options, but labels and menus vary. A simple scanning-and-tracking workflow helps you compare items quickly and stay consistent.

Dallas has strong health-food options, from local markets to restaurant menus. The challenge is separating marketing from nutrition and making choices that match your personal goals.

## A quick Dallas food-choice framework

| Step | What to do | Why it helps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scan or check labels | Look at ingredients and serving sizes | Cuts through marketing claims. |
| Prioritize whole foods | Lean proteins, vegetables, grains | Improves nutrient density. |
| Watch sodium and added sugar | Common in restaurant meals | Prevents hidden overload. |
| Track trends weekly | One meal isn’t the full story | Shows consistency. |

## Common “healthy” traps to watch

- Dressings or sauces with added sugar.
- Restaurant meals with high sodium.
- Seed oils or ultra-processed sides.

## What is Eatibo?

Eatibo is an AI food scanner and nutrition log focused on long-term health. It scans plates or labels, estimates calories plus macro and micro intake, and highlights additives, allergens, high sodium, or added sugars. Each item gets an Eat / Limit / Skip verdict with a short explanation, and the app tracks trends so you can spot nutrient gaps.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is Dallas a good city for healthy eating?

Yes. The key is choosing meals that align with your goals rather than relying on menu labels.

### How do I keep sodium reasonable when dining out?

Ask for sauces on the side and balance restaurant meals with lighter meals at home.

### Should I track every meal?

Not necessarily. Tracking a few meals per week can still reveal helpful trends.

### How do I compare two “healthy” products quickly?

Scan both labels and compare added sugar, sodium, and ingredient length.
