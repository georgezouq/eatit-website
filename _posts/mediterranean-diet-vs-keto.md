If you’re torn between Mediterranean and keto, you’re not alone. One promises quick scale drops; the other reads like a lifelong way to eat. The better pick hinges on your goal, your health markers, and your lifestyle. You can even blend ideas from both.

> Try this while you read: open **EatIt**, set your goal to **Keto** or **Mediterranean**, and scan a meal or barcode. You’ll see net carbs, fiber, saturated fat, and simple “Good / Limit / Skip” flags—so the article turns into action on your plate.

## At a glance

| Question | Mediterranean | Keto |
|---|---|---|
| Main idea | Plants, olive oil, seafood, whole grains, legumes, nuts | Very low carb, higher fat, moderate protein |
| Typical outcome | Steady weight loss, heart-friendly pattern | Faster early loss, strong appetite control for many |
| What you eat more of | Veggies, beans, whole grains, olive oil, fish | Eggs, meat/fish, non-starchy veg, oils, nuts |
| What you watch | Refined grains, ultra-processed foods | Net carbs, hidden sugars/starches |
| Social/longevity fit | Easy to keep at restaurants and with family | Works well if you enjoy structure and planning |

## What problem are you solving?

- **Quick weight drop for motivation.** Keto often moves the scale fast in the first few weeks, partly from water loss and a sharper calorie cut.  
- **Heart-forward pattern you can live with.** Mediterranean shines for long-term eating, emphasizing olive oil, fish, nuts, and lots of plants.  
- **Blood sugars and cravings.** Keto’s lower carb load can smooth spikes for some people; Mediterranean’s fiber and steady carbs help with satiety and stability.  
- **Cooking style and social life.** Mediterranean flexes easily for date nights and family gatherings. Keto works great if you enjoy meal-prepping and clear guardrails.

> In **EatIt**, switch between **Keto** and **Mediterranean** modes to see how the same meal scores differently. The app recalculates net carbs, highlights fiber gaps, and flags added sugars so you can edit on the fly.

## What a day can look like

### Mediterranean day (balanced carbs, fiber-rich)
- **Breakfast:** Greek yogurt with berries, walnuts, drizzle of honey  
- **Lunch:** Tuna-and-chickpea salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, olive-oil lemon dressing  
- **Snack:** Apple and a small piece of cheese  
- **Dinner:** Salmon, roasted veggies, small portion of farro, side salad

### Keto day (very low carb, higher fat)
- **Breakfast:** Omelet with spinach, mushrooms, feta  
- **Lunch:** Grilled chicken thigh over leafy greens with avocado and olive-oil vinaigrette  
- **Snack:** Handful of almonds  
- **Dinner:** Steak or tofu cooked in butter/olive oil with asparagus and a pat of herb butter

## Pros and trade-offs

### Mediterranean
- **Why people love it:** Tons of variety, easy to eat out, emphasizes whole foods and healthy fats.  
- **Watch-outs:** Portions of bread, pasta, and wine can creep up if you’re not mindful.

### Keto
- **Why people love it:** Clear rules, early momentum, fewer cravings for many.  
- **Watch-outs:** Socially trickier, fiber can drop if veggies and nuts are limited, and some folks miss fruit and grains.

> Use **EatIt’s “Nutrition Gaps”** insight to catch low fiber or omega-3s on keto, or rising added sugars on a loose Mediterranean day. The app nudges you toward fixes—like “swap in leafy greens” or “add canned sardines.”

## How to make either approach work in real life

**Build meals around non-starchy veggies.** Half your plate as greens, tomatoes, peppers, broccoli—works for both.  
**Pick proteins you actually enjoy.** Fish and legumes for Mediterranean; eggs, fish, and fatty cuts or tofu for keto.  
**Choose smarter fats.** Mediterranean leans on olive oil and nuts; keto can still use olive oil, avocado, and fatty fish instead of leaning only on processed meats.  
**Track what matters.** Net carbs and sugar alcohols matter on keto; fiber, whole-grain portions, and added sugars matter on Mediterranean.

### What EatIt does for you (quietly, in the background)
- **Barcode & label scan:** Instant macros, net carbs, added sugar, and ingredient alerts.  
- **Goal-aware scoring:** “Good / Limit / Skip” changes based on your chosen mode.  
- **Allergen & sensitivity flags:** Nuts, dairy, gluten, and more—clearly marked.  
- **Coach chat:** Ask, “Does this wrap fit keto?” or “How do I add more omega-3s today?” and get a snappy plan.  
- **Weekly trends:** See when fiber dips or saturated fat climbs so you can course-correct before it snowballs.

## Can you blend them?

Plenty of people run a **Mediterranean-keto hybrid**: very low net carbs, but with Mediterranean choices—olive oil, fish, nuts, heaps of non-starchy veggies—while going easy on processed meats. It keeps keto’s appetite control with a more heart-friendly fat profile.

> Toggle **Mediterranean** in EatIt, then switch to **Keto** and compare the same day. You’ll see exactly where to trim carbs while keeping olive oil, fish, and greens in the mix.

## A quick decision guide

- **You want a lifestyle pattern with social flexibility.** Mediterranean.  
- **You want a structured push to reset cravings.** Keto.  
- **You’re curious about both.** Try a four-week Mediterranean base, then a two-week keto block with EatIt guarding fiber and micronutrients.

**One last thing:** Nutrition is personal. If you have diabetes, kidney disease, high triglycerides, or you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, check in with your clinician before making big changes. EatIt is a guide, not a diagnosis.
