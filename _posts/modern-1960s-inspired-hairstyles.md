# 1960s Inspired Hairstyles: Retro Looks You Can Actually Wear Today

The ‘60s gave us clean, graphic shapes and soft, romantic volume. Think mod bobs with razor-sharp lines, big bouffants, and effortless curtain fringe. The best part is how well these looks translate now—keep the silhouette, tone down the stiffness, and you’ve got hair that feels iconic without feeling like a costume.

Below are five crowd-pleasing styles, how to wear them in 2025, and what to tell your stylist so the vibe lands just right.

## 1) The Mod Bob (Sassoon-inspired)

**Why it works now:** Clean lines frame the face and photograph beautifully. It’s polished without being high-maintenance.

**Ask your stylist for:** A jaw-length bob with a slight bevel, precise perimeter, optional short fringe. Keep layers minimal.

**Styling tip:** Blow-dry with a flat brush, add a pea-size smoothing cream, and tuck one side for that mod feel.

**Best for:** Straight to wavy hair; round and oval faces.

## 2) Bardot Bangs + Soft Layers

**Why it works now:** Soft curtain fringe opens the face and adds instant “French girl” energy without heavy styling.

**Ask your stylist for:** Long layers with cheek-skimming curtain bangs that split down the center.

**Styling tip:** Round-brush just the fringe, then let the rest air-dry with light mousse. Flip the ends slightly for a subtle ‘60s nod.

**Best for:** Wavy texture; heart, oval, and square faces.

## 3) The Modern Beehive (Low Bouffant Updo)

**Why it works now:** It gives height and drama for events without feeling shellacked.

**Ask your stylist for:** Crown volume with gentle backcombing, a low twist or pony, and soft face pieces. No crunchy lacquer.

**Styling tip:** Build volume with a volumizing powder at the crown, smooth the surface with a boar-bristle brush, finish with flexible hold.

**Best for:** Medium to thick hair; round and heart faces that like a little extra height.

## 4) Flipped Ends (The “Housewife Flip,” but Chic)

**Why it works now:** It’s playful and polished, great with headbands or a minimal outfit.

**Ask your stylist for:** Collarbone length with a blunt baseline and micro-layers to help the flip hold.

**Styling tip:** Blow-dry smooth, then use a large round brush or 1.25” iron to turn ends outward. Seal with a light gloss spray.

**Best for:** Straight to wavy hair; all face shapes.

## 5) The ‘60s Shag (Pre-‘70s, Soft and Airy)

**Why it works now:** Movement without bulk, bangs that grow out gracefully, and zero helmet vibes.

**Ask your stylist for:** Soft, graduated layers, light internal weight removal, and curtain fringe that blends into cheekbones.

**Styling tip:** Air-dry with sea-salt spray, scrunch once, and finish with a light texturizing powder at the crown.

**Best for:** Wavy to loosely curly hair; oval and square faces.

## Quick Fit Guide (Face Shape & Hair Type)

- **Round face:** Mod bob with a touch of bevel or a modern beehive to add height.  
- **Square face:** Bardot bangs soften angles; the shag’s movement helps too.  
- **Oval face:** You can wear them all—pick by styling time.  
- **Fine hair:** Mod bob or flipped ends with minimal layers for fullness.  
- **Thick hair:** Shag or Bardot set-up with interior debulking to reduce bulk.

## Products and Prep (Keep It Light)

- **Volume without crunch:** Mousse at the roots, flexible hairspray to finish.  
- **Shine without slip:** A drop of lightweight serum, mid-lengths to ends.  
- **Hold that isn’t stiff:** Texture spray or powder at the crown instead of heavy backcombing for everyday wear.

## What to tell your stylist (copy/paste)

> “I want a **1960s-inspired look** that still feels current. Keep the lines clean, avoid heavy, set curls, and finish with **soft, touchable texture**. I’d like styling that takes **under 10 minutes**.”
