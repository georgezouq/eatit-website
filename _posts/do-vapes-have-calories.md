**Quick answer:** Vape liquids contain calorie-containing ingredients, but the actual calorie impact from vaping is practically negligible for most people.

Vape liquids typically include propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavorings, and nicotine. While PG and VG have caloric value, the amount absorbed through vaping is tiny compared with daily food intake.
