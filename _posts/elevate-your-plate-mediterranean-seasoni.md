**Quick answer:** Mediterranean seasoning is a herb blend (often oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil, garlic, and onion) that adds flavor without heavy sauces.

Mediterranean seasoning is a simple spice blend used across Greek, Italian, and coastal dishes. It adds aroma and depth, helping meals taste richer without extra sugar or heavy fats.
