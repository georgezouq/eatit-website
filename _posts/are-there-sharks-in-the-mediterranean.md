**Quick answer:** Yes, the Mediterranean Sea has sharks, but human encounters are rare and most species are offshore or deep-water.

The Mediterranean is home to dozens of shark species. For travelers, the practical takeaway is simple: the chance of seeing one near a busy beach is very low, and swimming risk from sharks is minimal.

## What kinds of sharks live in the Mediterranean?

Researchers commonly estimate around 47 shark species in the Mediterranean. Well-known examples include the Great White Shark, Blue Shark, Mako Shark, and Hammerhead Sharks. Many are pelagic (open-water) species and not typical near-shore swimmers.

## Is swimming in the Mediterranean risky because of sharks?

For most swimmers, no. Encounters are rare, and many Mediterranean shark species prefer offshore waters. As with any ocean, normal safety habits are enough.

## Simple swim-safety habits

- Swim in groups and stay near lifeguarded areas.
- Avoid swimming at dawn or dusk when marine life is more active.
- Don’t enter the water with open wounds or shiny jewelry.
- Follow local signage and guidance.

## Travel note: enjoy the food too

Mediterranean travel usually means fresh seafood, olive oil, and seasonal vegetables. If you track meals while traveling, scanning a plate or menu can help you stay consistent without counting everything manually.
