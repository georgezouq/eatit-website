## Aisle-by-aisle smart shopping checklist

| Aisle | What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Snacks | Added sugar, seed oils | Snack items hide extras easily. |
| Pantry | Ingredient length | Shorter lists are usually simpler. |
| Frozen | Sodium and sauces | Frozen meals can stack sodium. |
| Dairy alternatives | Added sugars | “Healthy” labels can be misleading. |
| Supplements | Allergens and fillers | You want clean, clear labeling. |
