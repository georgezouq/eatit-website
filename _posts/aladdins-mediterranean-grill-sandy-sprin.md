## Frequently asked questions

### Is shawarma typically high in sodium?

It can be, especially with sauces. Asking for sauce on the side makes it easier to control.

Ask what oils are used for cooking and pick grilled items with minimal sauces.

### What’s a protein-forward order here?

Yes. Track portion size and pair with vegetables or a smaller amount of pita.
