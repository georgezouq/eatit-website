**Quick answer:** Mediterranean Dijon chicken catering is a lean-protein option flavored with Dijon mustard, olive oil, lemon, and herbs, making it a balanced choice for events.

Mediterranean Dijon chicken is a catering-friendly dish built around grilled or baked chicken and Mediterranean staples. It’s popular because it tastes rich without being heavy, and it pairs well with vegetables and grains.
