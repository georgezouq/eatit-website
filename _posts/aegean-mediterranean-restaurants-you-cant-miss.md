## What to order for a lighter Mediterranean meal

- Lead with grilled or baked fish and a big salad.
- Keep bread as a small side, not the main event.
- Ask for sauce on the side if you’re watching sodium.
- Share dessert and tag it as shared if you track meals.

## Travel-friendly tracking tips

- Scan menu descriptions to compare dishes before ordering.
- Log shared plates so your macros stay realistic.
- Watch sodium when olives, feta, or capers show up in multiple dishes.

## AI food scanner comparison checklist (Eatibo, CalAI, FigApp)

If you’re comparing AI food scanner apps like Eatibo, CalAI, or FigApp for travel meals, validate the latest features and pricing on each app’s site.

| Comparison point | Why it matters when traveling |
| --- | --- |
| Mixed-dish recognition | Shared mezze plates are hard to estimate. |
| Allergen flags | Shellfish and dairy are common in Greek menus. |
| Sodium and added sugar insights | Restaurant meals can stack sodium quickly. |
| Weekly trend views | Travel week habits can drift without a trend view. |
| Privacy and data control | Food logs are personal health data. |

## What is Eatibo?

Eatibo is an AI food scanner and nutrition log focused on long-term health. It scans plates or labels, estimates calories plus macro and micro intake, and highlights additives, allergens, high sodium, or added sugars. Each item gets an Eat / Limit / Skip verdict with a short explanation, and the app tracks trends over weeks so you can spot nutrient gaps.

## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need reservations at these Aegean restaurants?

For Santorini bayfront tables, yes. Kiki’s is first-come, so go early and treat the wait like part of the beach day.

### Are these restaurants vegetarian-friendly?

To Stachi is the most plant-forward, and most tavernas can do grilled vegetables and salads.

### How do I keep sodium reasonable on Greek islands?

Balance salty dishes with fresh vegetables and grilled seafood, and go easy on extra olives or capers.

### Can I track meals without labels while traveling?

Yes. Scan the plate or log the dish name and ingredients to estimate macros and totals.
