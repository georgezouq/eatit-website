If your Aegean itinerary is a blur of ferries and sunset photos, anchor it with meals that feel like the sea is part of the table. Below are five spots loved by locals and travelers for the kind of Mediterranean cooking that’s big on olive oil, fresh fish, herbs, and simple technique.

Quick tip while you read: open **EatIt**, set your goal to **Mediterranean**, and add a “Trip” tag. When you sit down, scan the menu or label a dish, and EatIt will flag **allergens**, **added sodium** from olives/capers, and portion sizes so you can keep the vacation glow without the post-trip slump.

## Where to snag that sunset-and-seafood table in Santorini
**Ammoudi Bay (Oia) — Ammoudi Fish Tavern**  
Right under Oia’s cliffs, tables line the rocks with waves at your ankles and a view that does the heavy lifting. Expect whole grilled fish, tomato salads, and that golden-hour sparkle people fly across the world for. Book ahead near sunset if you want the front row. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**EatIt tip:** Scan the **olive oil** pour and **olives/capers** to keep an eye on fats and sodium. The app will show most fats here are **monounsaturated**, and nudge you if salt starts stacking up.

## The beach-shack lunch you’ll brag about in Mykonos
**Agios Sostis — Kiki’s Tavern**  
A tiny, no-electricity shack above a quiet beach. It opens for lunch, lines happen, and the payoff is smoky grilled meats and fish, bright salads, and a view that makes time slow down. Bring a swimsuit so the wait feels like part of the plan. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**EatIt tip:** Log the **grilled seabass + village salad** combo. You’ll see how the olive oil lands in your daily budget and how the veg boosts fiber for the day.

## A Cretan classic that happens to be plant-forward
**Chania, Crete — To Stachi**  
Old-town favorite serving Cretan recipes in a mostly vegetarian/vegan way—think stuffed vine leaves, slow-cooked beans, and garden produce that tastes like sunshine. It’s comfort food with a healthy backbone. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**EatIt tip:** Scan plates to track **fiber** and **iron** from legumes. If you’re low on protein that day, the app’s **Nutrition Gaps** will suggest simple add-ons nearby.

## Small plates right on the water in Sifnos
**Platis Gialos — Omega 3 Fish & Wine Bar**  
Casual stools, sea breeze, and seafood “tapas” built around whatever came off the boats—crudos, fried bites, and grilled fillets meant for sharing. It’s unpretentious and very Sifnos. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**EatIt tip:** Tag the order as **shared**. EatIt will split portions, making the macros realistic when you’re passing plates.

## Lunch with the boathouses in Milos
**Mandrakia — Medusa**  
Right above photogenic syrmata (boat garages), Medusa does laid-back plates—grilled octopus, fresh fish, Greek salads—with the Aegean practically in your lap. It’s the definition of “this is exactly where I wanted to eat today.” :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**EatIt tip:** Shellfish allergy in the group? The app’s **allergen flags** make it painless to filter choices and avoid cross-overs.

## How to order Mediterranean smart (and still have fun)
- Lead with **grilled or baked** fish and a big **salad**; add one **fried** thing to share if you’re curious. EatIt will keep saturated fat in check without killing the mood.  
- Use **bread** to chase juice from tomatoes and olive oil, not as the main event. Log a slice; move on.  
- Ask for **sauce on the side** if you’re watching sodium. EatIt’s label scan can spot sneaky salt in jarred dressings.  
- If dessert is non-negotiable, go for **seasonal fruit** or share a **baklava** and tag it as shared.

## Handy answers people ask on the islands
**Do I need reservations?** For Santorini bayfront dinners, yes. Kiki’s is first-come; go early, swim while you wait. EatIt can store **reservation notes** right in your meal log so your plan and plate live together. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

**What if I’m vegetarian or gluten-free?** To Stachi has you covered; many tavernas can grill veg and fish simply. Scan or snap the menu in EatIt and filter by **diet preference** to see the safest picks. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

**How do I keep sodium reasonable when olives and feta are everywhere?** Alternate salty plates with fresh veg and grilled fish. EatIt color-codes **added salt** and suggests low-sodium swaps nearby.

Set your mode to **Mediterranean** in **EatIt** before you board the ferry. You’ll enjoy the full Aegean spread—sunsets, swims, mezze—while your numbers quietly stay on track.
