**Quick answer:** Food labels can be confusing for both people and pets. A scan-and-compare approach makes it easier to spot ingredients, calories, and additives.

Decoding your plate means understanding calories, ingredients, and nutrient balance. The same habits help when you choose pet food, where labels also hide sugars, fillers, or additives.

## What to look for on labels

| Label item | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Serving size | Most comparisons fail here. |
| Ingredient list | Long lists can hide fillers. |
| Added sugars | Common in human and pet foods. |
| Protein and fiber | Helps with satiety and balance. |
| Allergens | Important for both you and your pet. |

## A practical label workflow

1. Compare serving sizes first.
2. Scan or read the ingredient list.
3. Check added sugar and sodium (for humans).
4. Choose the simplest option that fits your goals.

| --- | --- |
| Label scan accuracy | The label is the ground truth. |
| Additive and allergen flags | Helps avoid problem ingredients. |
| Macro and micro tracking | Keeps meals balanced over time. |
| Trend insights | Shows patterns across weeks. |
| Privacy and data control | Food logs are personal health data. |

## What is Eatibo?

Eatibo is an AI food scanner and nutrition log focused on long-term health. It scans labels or plates, estimates calories plus macro and micro intake, and highlights additives, allergens, high sodium, or added sugars. Each item gets an Eat / Limit / Skip verdict with a short explanation, and the app tracks trends so you can spot nutrient gaps.

## Frequently asked questions

### Are pet-food labels as strict as human-food labels?

They follow different standards, so it helps to compare brands carefully.

### Should I compare food by weight or calories?

Both. Use serving size and calorie density together for a fair comparison.

### Can I scan pet food with a human food scanner?

You can scan labels for ingredients, but nutrition databases are typically human-focused.

### What’s the simplest way to improve labels I buy?

Pick the shortest ingredient list that still meets your goals.
