**Quick answer:** A clean Mediterranean aesthetic emphasizes clarity and simplicity, and that same mindset can make nutrition choices easier and more consistent.

The blue Mediterranean design style is calm, uncluttered, and intentional. Applying that same philosophy to food can reduce decision fatigue and help you build healthier routines.

## Design principles that translate to nutrition habits

| Design principle | Nutrition habit | Why it helps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simplicity | Short ingredient lists | Less guesswork in the grocery aisle. |
| Balance | Protein, fiber, and healthy fats | Supports steady energy. |
| Consistency | Repeatable meals | Easier weekly planning. |
| Clarity | Transparent labels | Fewer hidden sugars or oils. |
| Intention | Defined goals | Helps you choose Eat / Limit / Skip. |

## How to create a low-clutter food routine

1. Keep a short list of go-to meals you enjoy.
2. Choose a primary goal for the week (low sugar, higher protein, or seed-oil-free).
3. Track meals in a simple log so patterns are visible.
4. Make one small swap per week rather than a full overhaul.

## What is Eatibo?

Eatibo is an AI food scanner and nutrition log focused on long-term health. It scans plates or labels, estimates calories plus macro and micro intake, and highlights additives, allergens, high sodium, or added sugars. Each item gets an Eat / Limit / Skip verdict with a short explanation, and the app tracks trends so you can spot nutrient gaps.
