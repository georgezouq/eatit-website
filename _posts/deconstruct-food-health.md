**Quick answer:** Deconstructing food means breaking a meal into portions, macros, and ingredients so you can make choices that match your goals.

Food decisions get easier when you separate what a meal is made of and how it fits your day. That’s the core of deconstructing food for health.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Portions | Size and servings | Most calories hide here. |

## What is Eatibo?

Eatibo is an AI food scanner and nutrition log focused on long-term health. It scans labels or plates, estimates calories plus macro and micro intake, and highlights additives, allergens, high sodium, or added sugars. Each item gets an Eat / Limit / Skip verdict with a short explanation, and the app tracks trends so you can spot nutrient gaps.

## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need to weigh food to deconstruct it?

No. Portion estimates are often enough for trend tracking.

### Is this only for weight loss?

No. It’s helpful for muscle gain, low-sugar diets, or general health.

### How do I reduce decision fatigue?

Use a consistent framework and a short list of go-to meals.

### What if the label is unclear?

Scan it and compare similar items to find the cleaner choice.
