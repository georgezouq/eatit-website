**Quick answer:** Dave's Hot Chicken is a high-calorie, high-sodium fast-casual option. Portions, breading, sauces, and sides drive most of the calorie load.

Dave’s Hot Chicken is known for spicy, breaded chicken and hearty sides. That makes it delicious, but it can also make total calories and sodium add up quickly.

## What drives calories the most

| Item factor | Impact | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Breading and frying | Higher calories | Adds oil and carbs. |
| Sauces | Added sugar and sodium | Can double the impact. |
| Sides | Fries and mac add density | Often as big as the main. |
| Portion size | Larger combos | Harder to fit daily targets. |

## Smarter ordering ideas

- Choose a smaller combo or split a larger one.
- Keep sauces on the side.
- Pair with lighter sides when possible.
- Treat it as a main meal, not a snack.
