**Quick answer:** Dorade (sea bream) is a mild, flaky fish that crisps well in a hot pan and pairs naturally with olive oil, lemon, and herbs.

Dorade, also called sea bream, is a Mediterranean fish known for its tender texture and clean flavor. It’s a lean protein that works well for quick, healthy home cooking.

## Dorade nutrition and cooking snapshot

## How to get crispy skin (simple method)

1. Pat the fish dry so the skin crisps.
2. Score the skin lightly to prevent curling.
3. Heat a pan with olive oil until shimmering.
4. Sear skin-side down for 3–5 minutes.
5. Flip and cook 2–4 minutes, or finish in a 375°F oven.
6. Aim for an internal temperature of 145°F if you use a thermometer.
