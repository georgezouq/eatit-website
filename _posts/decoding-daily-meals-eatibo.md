**Quick answer:** Daily meal tracking is easiest when you can scan a plate or label and get immediate calories, macros, and ingredient flags.

Decoding daily meals means understanding what you eat without turning every meal into a math problem. A scan-first workflow helps you stay consistent and see trends.

## What to decode in a daily meal

| Item to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Portion size | Most calorie swings come from portions. |
| Added sugar | Often hidden in sauces and drinks. |
| Sodium | Can be high in packaged foods. |
| Protein and fiber | Supports satiety and energy. |
| Additives and allergens | Helps avoid ingredients you don’t want. |

## A simple daily tracking routine

1. Scan or log the main meal.
2. Add one or two sides or drinks.
3. Review the Eat / Limit / Skip result.
4. Make a small swap if needed.
5. Check weekly trends at the end of the week.

## What is Eatibo?

Eatibo is an AI food scanner and nutrition log focused on long-term health. It scans plates or labels, estimates calories plus macro and micro intake, and highlights additives, allergens, high sodium, or added sugars. Each item gets an Eat / Limit / Skip verdict with a short explanation, and the app tracks trends so you can spot nutrient gaps.

## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need to log every meal?

No. Logging the biggest or most variable meals can still show useful trends.

### Does scanning work on homemade meals?

Yes. Scan the plate or log key ingredients for a best estimate.

### How fast can I see results?

Most people see clearer habits within a week of consistent logging.

### What if I forget to log a meal?

Log it later or estimate. Consistency matters more than perfection.
