You don’t need a restaurant kitchen to cook like a pro. We asked an Italian Michelin-experienced chef to walk us through two dishes that feel special yet work on a Tuesday: **Roasted Branzino with Tomatoes & Olives** and a **Sicilian Caponata** you can serve spooned over warm whole-grain farro. Both hit the Mediterranean notes—olive oil, seafood or vegetables, herbs, acid—without making you babysit a pan for an hour.

While you cook, open **Eatibo** and set your goal to **Mediterranean**. Scan ingredients as you go—olive oil, canned tomatoes, olives, even that loaf of bread—and you’ll see fiber, sodium, and “Good / Limit / Skip” flags in real time. It’s a quiet sous-chef that keeps your plate aligned with your goals.

## Dish #1: Roasted Branzino with Tomatoes & Olives (Serves 2)

**Why it works for the Mediterranean diet**  
Lean fish, generous but measured extra-virgin olive oil, lots of tomatoes and herbs, and a salty hit from olives. Bright, light, deeply satisfying.

**Ingredients**
- 2 whole branzino (about 1 lb / 450 g each), cleaned and scaled  
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved  
- 1/2 cup pitted Castelvetrano or Kalamata olives  
- 2 Tbsp capers, rinsed  
- 2 lemons (zest one, slice the other)  
- 3 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil  
- 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced  
- Fresh thyme or oregano, a few sprigs  
- Kosher salt and black pepper

**Technique notes from the chef**
- Pat the fish dry so the skin roasts, not steams.  
- Score the thickest part of each side; seasoning can reach the flesh and it cooks more evenly.  
- Toss tomatoes, olives, capers, garlic, lemon zest, and 2 Tbsp olive oil on a sheet pan; season. Lay fish on top, tuck lemon slices and herbs inside the cavity, drizzle the last Tbsp oil, and season the skin.  
- Roast at **450°F / 230°C** for **12–15 minutes** until the flesh flakes and the tomatoes blister. Finish with a squeeze of lemon.

**Eatibo in action**  
Scan the olive oil and olives to keep an eye on **added sodium** and total fats. Eatibo will nudge portion size and show you that most fats here are **monounsaturated**—a Mediterranean green light.

**Swaps & shortcuts**
- No branzino? Trout or snapper works; fillets cut the roast to about 8–10 minutes.  
- Prefer dairy? A spoon of plain yogurt mixed with lemon and grated cucumber makes a quick tzatziki on the side.  
- Crusty whole-grain bread is classic; Eatibo will flag portions if your carbs are running high that day.

## Dish #2: Sicilian Caponata over Warm Farro (Serves 4 as a side, 2 as a main)

Silky eggplant, sweet-sour tomatoes, celery crunch, a little briny pop. The chef’s trick is gentle heat and a splash of vinegar at the end.

**Ingredients**
- 1 large eggplant (about 1 lb / 450 g), 1-inch cubes  
- 1 medium onion, diced  
- 2 celery stalks, diced  
- 1 red bell pepper, diced (optional but lovely)  
- 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes  
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste  
- 1/3 cup green olives, chopped  
- 2 Tbsp capers, rinsed  
- 1/4 cup golden raisins  
- 3–4 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil  
- 2–3 Tbsp red wine vinegar  
- Pinch of sugar or a few drops of honey (balance)  
- Fresh basil, torn; parsley, chopped  
- Kosher salt and black pepper  
- 1 cup farro (dry), cooked per package for serving (optional but recommended)

**Method that keeps it jammy, not greasy**
- Salt the eggplant cubes for 15 minutes, rinse, pat dry.  
- Warm 2 Tbsp oil in a wide pan; cook onion and celery with a pinch of salt until glossy. Add bell pepper.  
- Add eggplant and another Tbsp oil; let it take on light color. Stir in tomato paste; cook until brick red.  
- Add crushed tomatoes, olives, capers, raisins. Simmer gently until the eggplant is silky.  
- Balance with vinegar and a touch of sweetness; season. Fold in herbs.  
- Serve warm or room temp over hot farro.

**Eatibo in action**  
Scan your **canned tomatoes** and **olives** to check **added salt**. Eatibo’s **Nutrition Gaps** will highlight if your day is light on **fiber**—farro fixes that in one scoop. Want lower carbs at dinner? Skip the farro and add a protein, like grilled shrimp.

## Chef’s tiny upgrades that change everything
- Use **great olive oil**. It should smell like grass or green tomato. Eatibo will log your pour so you don’t overshoot calories.  
- Don’t fear **acid**. A squeeze of lemon on the fish and a splash of vinegar in caponata wakes up every flavor.  
- Keep **heat moderate**. Browning is flavor; burning is regret.  
- Finish with **fresh herbs**. The perfume sells the dish before it hits the table.

## Smart questions people ask (quick answers)
**Can I make branzino in an air fryer?** Yes—425°F / 220°C for about 10–12 minutes; check for flaking.  
**Is caponata good for meal prep?** Even better the next day. Store 3–4 days; Eatibo can track leftovers so your week stays balanced.  
**Gluten-free idea?** Serve caponata over quinoa or a chickpea mash.  
**What wine pairs well?** A Sicilian Grillo or a crisp Vermentino won’t overpower the herbs and lemon.

## Make it yours with Eatibo
Set your goal to **Mediterranean** and log tonight’s plate with a quick scan. Eatibo will celebrate the olive oil and veggies, keep an eye on sodium from olives and capers, and show whether you hit your **fiber** and **omega-3** targets. Cooking like a chef is fun; cooking like a chef who knows their numbers is how habits stick.
