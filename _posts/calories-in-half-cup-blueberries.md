Ever scooped a generous half-cup of blueberries, assuming it was a 'freebie' snack? Many of us do! It's easy to think that because fruit is healthy, its calories don't really count. But for anyone tracking their intake, or simply trying to make more informed food choices, understanding the numbers, even for healthy items, is incredibly important.

Whether you're aiming for weight loss, managing blood sugar, or just eating mindfully, precision can make a big difference.

## So, how many calories are actually in a 1/2 cup of blueberries?

Let's get straight to the point. A 1/2 cup (or about 74 grams) of fresh blueberries contains approximately **42 calories**. This might seem like a small number, but every calorie adds up, especially when you're mindful of your daily intake.

Beyond calories, this serving size also offers a good nutritional profile. You're looking at around 10.7 grams of carbohydrates, with about 1.8 grams of dietary fiber and 7.3 grams of natural sugars. Blueberries are also about 84% water, contributing to that feeling of fullness. Imagine getting this precise calorie and macro breakdown instantly, just by pointing your phone at your fruit bowl? That's exactly what Eatibo does—no more guessing or searching.

## Beyond the numbers: What makes blueberries so good for you?

Blueberries are often hailed as a superfood, and for good reason! While their calorie count is modest, their nutritional density is impressive. They are packed with antioxidants, particularly anthocyanins, which give them their vibrant blue hue and are linked to numerous health benefits.

A 1/2 cup serving also provides a good dose of Vitamin C, essential for immune function and skin health, and Vitamin K, important for blood clotting and bone health. You'll also find manganese, which plays a role in bone development and metabolism. These nutrients contribute to heart health, improved brain function, and can even help reduce inflammation.

## Portion control decoded: Why a 'half-cup' isn't always obvious

We've all been there – pouring a "small" bowl of cereal or grabbing a "handful" of nuts. When it comes to something like blueberries, a "half-cup" can easily become a full cup if you're not measuring. Our eyes can often play tricks on us, leading to unintentional overeating, even of healthy foods. This misjudgment of portions can lead to what's known as "calorie creep," where small, uncounted calories add up over the day or week, potentially hindering your goals.

This is where tools like Eatibo become invaluable. Instead of eyeballing or pulling out measuring cups every time, Eatibo's AI scanner helps you get accurate calorie, macro, and even additive information for servings of blueberries and thousands of other foods, helping you 'Eat smarter, one scan at a time.'

## Putting blueberries into your meal plan: Smart swaps and balanced plates

Knowing the calorie count for 1/2 cup of blueberries empowers you to incorporate them into your diet strategically. They're fantastic in morning oatmeal or yogurt, blended into smoothies, or even tossed into a salad for a burst of sweetness.

If you're aiming for a lower-calorie snack, remember that 1/2 cup of blueberries is roughly equivalent in calories to about 1 cup of sliced strawberries or raspberries, which offer slightly more volume for the same calorie count. The key is to balance them with other nutrient-rich foods to create a satisfying and well-rounded meal or snack.

## Your personal nutrition guide: Making every bite count

Understanding the data behind your food, even for small servings of something as healthy as blueberries, is a powerful step towards achieving your health goals. It's not about restriction, but about making informed choices that align with your body's needs and your personal objectives. By knowing what you're eating, you gain control and confidence in your dietary decisions.
