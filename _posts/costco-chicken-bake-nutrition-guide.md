**Quick answer:** The Costco Chicken Bake is a high-calorie, high-sodium food court item. Estimates often place it around 700–800 calories, so treat it as an occasional meal rather than a daily option.

The Costco Chicken Bake is a warm, stuffed pastry filled with chicken, bacon, cheese, and Caesar-style dressing. Because ingredients and recipes can change, check current nutrition info when it’s available.
