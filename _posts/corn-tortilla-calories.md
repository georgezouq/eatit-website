**Quick answer:** A standard 6-inch corn tortilla is often around 50–60 calories, while a similar-size flour tortilla is usually higher. Brand and size matter, so check labels for exact numbers.

Corn tortillas are made from masa harina and water, and they’re often a lighter base for tacos than flour tortillas. Calories are driven mostly by size and preparation.
